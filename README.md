Time-series clustering of global vaccination coverage data
================
Hasan Jamil

Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions to
prevent infectious diseases and reduce mortality and morbidity. However,
there are still significant gaps and inequalities in vaccination
coverage across countries and regions, which pose challenges for
achieving global health goals and ensuring equity. Understanding the
patterns and drivers of vaccination coverage among countries can help
inform policy decisions and interventions to improve immunization
programs and outcomes.

In this project, we propose a data-driven approach to analyze global
vaccination coverage data using time-series clustering techniques.
Time-series clustering is a method of grouping time series data based on
their similarity in shape, trend, or variability. By applying
time-series clustering to vaccination coverage data, we aim to identify
clusters of countries that have similar or dissimilar vaccination trends
over time, and explore the characteristics and factors that explain the
differences or similarities among the clusters.

We will use the WHO vaccination data from 2021 as our main data source,
which contains information on 15 vaccines for 194 countries.

## Loading the data

``` r
path <- "wuenic2021rev_web-update.xlsx"
sheet_names <- excel_sheets("wuenic2021rev_web-update.xlsx")
data_list <- list()
for (i in seq_along(sheet_names)) {

agg_data <- data_list[[15]] 
data_list <- data_list[1:14]
data_combined <- do.call(rbind, data_list)
```

## Making the data in long formate tidy

``` r
data_combined <- pivot_longer(data_combined, cols = c(5:ncol(data_combined)), names_to = "year", values_to = "coverage")
data_combined$year <- as.Date(paste0(data_combined$year, "-01-01"))
```

## Discovering the global trend for each vaccine

``` r
global_data <- agg_data %>%
  filter(region == "Global")
p <- ggplot(global_data, aes(x = year, y = coverage, color = vaccine)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()

## Checking Countries with Conflict

## Plotting the coverage of DTP3 for these countries

``` r

  geom_line() +
  theme_bw()
